## This file represents the documentation for the shiny application

These are the steps to use the application

1. You find the variables of the mtcars dataset in the side bar panel. 
2. The first set is for you to set the dependent variable.
3. The second set is for you to set the predictor.
4. After you choose both variables (y and x in your model), some calculations will be displayed in the main panel.
5. First, a linear model is generated and the formula used is displayed.
6. Then, the coefficients of the model are displayed
7. Finally, a plot with the two variables and the line representing the model is displayed.

Note: If both variables are the same, no model is generated and no plot is displayed.
